s6 = "The United States has been looking for a hidden North Korean east coast noun site or mobile launchers, a concern because a launch from the east coast would go over propNoun, the official said. "
s7 = "It is believed a noun launch would be a \"test\" launch rather than a targeted verb. That is because it appears the North Koreans have only moved the components so far. The United States is waiting to see whether North Korea issues a notice to its airmen and mariners to stay out of the region."
