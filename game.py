# Final Game
# The game will begin after you hit load program

#You should display a welcome message when the game starts. 
#If the user types help at any time, you should redisplay the welcome message
#If the user types exit at any time they should be able to quit the game
#In each room, you should:
#Print a description of the room
#Give the user the directions that they are allowed to move
#Ask the user (via requestString) which direction they would like to go
#Process the answer and respond accordingly
